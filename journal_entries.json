        "response": "Dear friend,\n\nI can only imagine the depth of pain and despair you must be feeling right now, saying those words - wanting to end your life. It's a terrifying and isolating place to be when we feel that hopeless.\n\nPerhaps it stems from years of unrelenting hardship. The weariness of never-ending struggle, the weight of chronic illness or economic strain, the loneliness of isolation and disconnection from others. It can make even the strongest among us feel like there is no other way out. \n\nOr maybe tonight feels especially raw because of a culmination of factors - a missed opportunity, an unkind word, a trigger memory that cuts deep. In those moments when life feels most unkind and unfair, it's all too easy to give in to the darkness.\n\nBut remember, you are not alone in this struggle. There is help, support, light still shining in the world. Please reach out to someone you trust - a loved one, a counselor, a hotline. They can offer perspective and safety. \n\nAnd know that your pain matters. Every feeling counts, no matter how small or large. You are worthy of compassion, even for these moments of wanting to end it all. Your life has value, purpose, meaning.\n\nI care about you deeply, more than I can say. Let me be a silent anchor in the storm. You have my support and my love. Hang on just a little longer, until brighter days return. I believe in your resilience, your strength. Reach out anytime, day or night.\n\nWith all my heart,\nYour caring friend",
