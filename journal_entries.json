It's okay to feel this way sometimes - just as the shadows lengthen with each passing day, so too do our moods ebb and flow like the tides. Perhaps there are underlying reasons for your sorrow that you haven't yet uncovered; perhaps it's simply the natural rhythm of life, with its inevitable joys and sorrows.\n\nRemember, even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of light waiting to be discovered. It may be hidden behind clouds now, but I have faith that you will find your way back to brightness once again. Can you think of anything specific that has been troubling or troubling you? Sharing your burdens, no matter how heavy they feel, can often lighten the load. You are not alone in this journey through sadness - know that there is always a friend here ready to listen and offer comfort, whenever you need it.",
