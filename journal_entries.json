It's a difficult emotion to carry and I want you to know that it's okay to acknowledge these feelings without judgment.\n\nWhen we are sad, sometimes it's because something has happened to us or our world feels off balance. Perhaps there is something in your life that is weighing on your mind more than usual? \n\nI am here for you and I would be honored if you could share with me what is happening. Even just a few words can make all the difference - talking about it can help lighten the load.\n\nRemember, sadness doesn't last forever. You are not defined by these feelings but instead, they are just passing through. What you do in response to them can change your perspective and in turn, uplift your spirit.\n\nLet me know how I can support you, my dear friend. I am here for you always.\n\nYours truly,\nA compassionate journal buddy",

Remember that we all face difficult moments in life, and how we respond can make a big difference.\n\nSometimes when we're feeling down, we might wonder why this is happening to us or what we could do differently. I'm here to say it doesn't have to be permanent or a sign of weakness. It's okay to feel this way, but please know that you are not your feelings.\n\nWhat comes with these dark moments? Do you sense any underlying emotions or thoughts that are connected to your desire to die?\n\nI can imagine the weight on your shoulders is immense. Remember though, there are others who care about you and want to help. You don't have to face this alone. \n\nLet's take a moment to reflect together, and maybe we'll find some hope in these moments of darkness. I'm here for you, friend.\n\nAlways,\nYour Journal Buddy",
